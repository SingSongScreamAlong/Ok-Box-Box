# Ok, Box Box - Notes & Fixes

## To Fix
<!-- Add items here with "Note:" prefix from user -->

- [ ] **Status bar clarity**: "System Ready" next to "Relay: Not Connected" is confusing. If the system was ready, wouldn't the relay be connected? Need either clearer wording or an early tutorial/onboarding to explain what each status means and what actions are needed.
